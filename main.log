(scrbook)              not mean, that KOMA-Script is fully compatible with
(scrbook)              the old release. If you need full compatibility

(scrbook)              refuse support for documents using `version=first'.

I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be

you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the

simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace

you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
