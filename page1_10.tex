	    \item Every process has an owner and group affiliation.
	    \item Every user in the system is assigned a unique user id (uid) and group id (gid).
	    \item User names and user id are stored in  /etc/passwd file.

	    \item Whenever a user is created a mail box is created automatically in /var/spool/mail location.
	    \item And some user environmental files like  .bash\_logout,  .bash\_profile,  .bashrc ,  ...etc., are also copied from /etc/skell   to  his/her home directory (/home/<username>).

         <user's home directory>  :   <login shell
         (where   'x'   means link to password file ie.,  /etc/shadow   file)

    \item \textbf {In how many ways can we create the users?}
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item Ans. \textbf{useradd} - <options><user name>
	    \item (ii)  \textbf{adduser}    - <options><user name>
	    \item (iii) \textbf{newusers}    <file name>   (In this file we have to enter the user details same as /etc/passwd   file)

        directory> -s <shell><user name> 
        \newline
        \textbf{Example:} useradd  -u  600  -g  600  -G  java   -c  "oracle user"   -d  /home/raju   -s /bin/bash raju

    \item\textbf{What is the syntax of newuser command?}
    \newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ans.newusers   <file name>	(This command will create multiple users at a time)
        \item First we should a file and enter user's data as fields same as the fields of /etc/passwd file for how many users do you want to create and mention that file as an argument for newusers command.
        \item When we execute this command new users will be created but their environmental files like        
    \end{itemize}  
        \textbf{bash\_logout,bash\_profile,bashrc and bash\_history}  files will not be copied from /etc/skell.
         Directory. So, we have to  copied manually from  /etc/skell   directory.

     \bigskip
     \bigskip
     
     \item\textbf{What is the syntax of userdel command with full options?}
     \newline
      Ans.userdel     <options><user name>

         id   <user name>   (It shows the user id group id and user name if that is already created)
         grep <user name> /etc/passwd

    \item\textbf{How to verify or check the integrity of the password file?}
    \newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ans.pwck   <options>   /etc/passwd    or
        \item pwck   <options>   /etc/shadow 
        \item The options are,   -q :quiet
              r : read only	
              s : sort the contents by uidin /etc/passwd and  /etc/shadow  files
    \end{itemize}

    \item\textbf{How to verify or check the integrity of the group file?}
    \newline
    \begin{itemize}

        \item The options are,    -r:read only
                                  -s:sort the contents by  \textbf{gidin  /etc/group   and   /etc/gshadow files.}
